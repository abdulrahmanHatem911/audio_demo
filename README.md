## Features

- **Audio Playback**: Enjoy your favorite audio files using the UST audio library. With this library, you can harness sound in various ways, delivering high-quality audio playback.

- **Background Playback**: The audio service library allows you to use the application in the background, ensuring that your users can listen to their favorite tunes while using other apps or with the screen turned off.

- **Playlist Expansion**: One of the key features we're working on is expanding the number of songs in the playlist. This will enable users to create extensive playlists filled with their favorite tracks.

- **Random Audio Shuffling**: We're also working on adding a random shuffle feature to make the listening experience more dynamic and exciting. Users will be able to enjoy their music collection in a new and unexpected way.
